title: The simplest Selenium application from scratch
---


Here I want to share my first Selenium application which launches a browser, opens a web-page and looks up the weather in a particular location by typing some text in the search box and clicking "Search". 

The following components are required: 

 - Selenium
 - Geckodriver
 - IntelliJ IDEA IDE 
 - Firefox 

This tutorial assumes you use Firefox, but it can be easily adapted to other browsers.
