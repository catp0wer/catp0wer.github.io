title: The simplest Selenium application from scratch
---


Here I want to share my first Selenium application which launches a browser, opens a web-page and looks up the weather in a particular location by typing some text in the search box and clicking "Search". 

The following components are required: 

 - Selenium
 - Geckodriver
 - IntelliJ IDEA IDE 
 - Firefox 

This tutorial assumes you use Firefox, but it can be easily adapted to other browsers.
                                                                                                                                                                                      

##### Selenium
Download Selenium for Java from here: http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

Put it in a location you want Selenium to be and remember the location. The path will be necessary when creating our project in IDE.
